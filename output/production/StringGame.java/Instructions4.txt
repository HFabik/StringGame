Two-way hangman
Pick a category. 
Both you and the computer pick a word in that category. 
You will imput your word replacing all letters with dashes (ex. "apple" becomes "-----"). 
The computer will do the same. 
You will guess a letter. 
The computer will display whether it is correct or incorrect and display the word in its current state.
Then the computer will guess a letter.
You will say whether or not it is correct, and the updated word.
The first to guess the other's word wins!
